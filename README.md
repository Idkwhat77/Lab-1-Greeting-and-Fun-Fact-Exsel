## Introduction

Hi there! My name is Exsel Octaviand Gosal. My first Project for my OOP (Object Oriented Programming) Class is to make a sort of greeting and also displaying a fun fact about Java and the version of Java that's currently running in a device, which is the repository that you're currently looking at. Just a simple greeting and fun fact sounds too boring to me, so my way to make it unique is to create different personalities that will each have unique greetings/dialog.

## Environment Setup

- JDK (Java Development Kit) Version 23.0.2 
- Visual Studio Code as my IDE (Integrated Development Environment) because my laptop is a potato and can't handle any other ones.
- Git as a way to push files to Github

Downloading JDK was easy enough to do, and for Visual Studio Code, I have it installed since the beginning of time so I had no problem with it. I learned how to use Git from my previous semester so I can now effectively push files instead of manually uploading them.

## Challenges

There are many challenges that I faced when working on this assignment, such as :

- Which fun facts to add, no joke. The hardest part was trying to find which fun facts are "fun" enough to be included. At the end, I just decided on 10 random ones I found off the internet (credits on the .java file)
- Figuring out what dialogue fits with each personality, especially Fischl's dialogue. I looked through her voicelines and tried to mimic it as best as I can. It's not perfect, but it's good enough.
- Error Handling when the scanner input's data type isn't correct. I just asked **ChatGPT** for this since I had no idea on how to implement that...
- Manually copy pasting ANSI color codes. This was fixed by giving each ANSI code a easy to remember variable instead (Thank you @KeaneKen for the idea)
