## Introduction

Hi there! My name is Exsel Octaviand Gosal. My first Project for my OOP (Object Oriented Programming) Class is to make a sort of greeting and also displaying a fun fact about Java and the version of Java that's currently running in a device. My take on this topic is too create different personalities that will have a unique greeting from the other personalities.

## Environment Setup

- JDK (Java Development Kit) Version 23.0.2 
- Visual Studio Code as my IDE (Integrated Development Environment) because my laptop is a potato.
- Git as a way to push files to Github without manually uploading everytime.

## Challenges

There are many challenges that I faced when working on this assignment, such as :

- Which fun facts to add. No joke. The hardest part was trying to find which fun facts are "fun" enough to be included. 
- Figuring out the dialogue that fits with each personality.
